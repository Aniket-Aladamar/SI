              <p class="animated fadeInUp">The Aztecs were a Mesoamerican culture that flourished in central Mexico in the post-classic period from 1300 to 1521.The Aztecs practiced aquaponics as far back as 1150 AD. Known as chinampas, their method consisted of creating artificial islands from grasses and reeds that typically measured 30 × 2.5 meters.</p>

              <p class="animated fadeInUp">Aquaponics is the farming of fish and plants in a single recirculating system, The waste from, the fish becomes the nutrients for the plants, and the plants in turn remove these nutrients from the water, purifying it for the fish . in this way, the fish waste is used to grow a plant crop that becomes a second income stream for little extra cost. in fact, it works so well that the plants become the primary crop by volume and value . </p>

              <p class="description">In this the plants are rooted in coarse gravel or aggreate media. bacteria grow on the media and convert the ammonia excerted by the fish to nitrate. plants within the grow beads remove the nitrate from the water, which then returns to the fish in a clean and healthy form. No mrchanical or biologival filtration is required as the gravel beds suit both purposes. this method is most variable in terms of the reange of crops that can be grown and there is no waste water discharge . </p>

              <p class="description">The water from the fish is filtered mechanically and biologically to remove the solids from suspension and convert the toxic ammonia to benign nitrate . this clean water then travels down the length od a tank of water in which polustyrene rafts are floated . plants are rooted through the holes in the polystyrene sheets and into the water below , where the roots take up nutirnts from the water . DWC is most suited to leafy crops and there is some dischare of water during the filtration process.</p>

NFT is a ver susceptiable to heat uptake or loss as the air temperature changes , and the plants can be lost quickly through drying out during a power failure . this method also results in the loss of water and nutients duringfilter cleaning , and is also best suited to leafy crops </p>

                <p class="description">One of the significant benefits of aquaponic growing is minimal water is wasted compared to the traditional growing method, like soil gardening. Although the name implies 'water,' aquaponics uses approximately 90% less water than conventional agriculture. The water is rarely changed or discarded since it’s recycled repeatedly through the entire system. </p>

                <h4 class="title"><a href="">Small Footprint</a></h4>
                <p class="description">Aquaponics farming does not require farmland with fertile soil. Aquaponics can be done successfully on any land, cement, gravel, rocky surfaces, or even drought lands, which are difficult to use in conventional farms.</p>

                <h4 class="title"><a href="">Minimal Weeding</a></h4>
                <p class="description">There is no soil involved in aquaponics, so there are very few weeds that will pop up in your garden, giving you more time to enjoy your garden</p>

          <h3>OUR APPROACH </h3>
          <p>Initially we had a simple approach towards our project that was to breed fishes and use their ammonia rich feces as nutrients for the germinated plants which would grow but unfortunately improper breeding and negligence caused the death of few fishes and hence forcing us to restart the project. A proper plan and few guidance about growing fishes from internet helped us to build up a proper model which provided us the desired result. We planted coriander and green gram plants and used gold fishes, our approach was modest, we did not want to add complex elements to the model which would consume a large amount of time. After a basic growth of plant, we began changing the parameters; harden and soften the water, changing the temperature of water and changing the pH and had different observations. Maintaining the model on such a small case was a hard task amid which we had to face a lot of problems in management of it. <br> <br> <br>
          Our experiment model comprises of a fish tank to a NFT channel pipe using pump/motor the plants absorbed the nutrients from the water present in the NFT channel and then the NFT channel carries the water back to the fish tank, this completes the cyclic process of the model and intend to measure our data measurements to observe the changes.</p>
